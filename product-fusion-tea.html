                                sweet brew is golden in colour & has herbal and fruity notes. It has a smooth texture.
                                People prefer Chamomile Green Tea, as it has less caffeine & is loaded with
                                antioxidants, which may lower risks of heart disease & cancer. Researches proves that,
                                it helps in relieving stress, gives better sleep, supports better skin, aids in
                                digestion & strengthens the immune system. It has anti-inflammatory properties too. It
                                has a soothing & calming effect and helps in promotion of good sleep. Ideally, one
                                should drink one cup of Chamomile Green Tea, about 45 minutes before sleeping, thus

                                    GINGER LEMON GREEN TEA</h2>
                                <p>Ginger, lemon & green tea is a potent combination, of three beneficial ingredients.
                                    The flavour is quite complex. It is spicy & sweet. It is a natural energy enhancer.
                                    Let's evaluate the benefits of the three ingredients separately. Ginger is a common
                                    folk remedy, for nausea & an upset stomach. It also aids digestion & saliva flow.
                                    Ginger may help in painful menstrual periods. Clinical evidence proves that, ginger
                                    may assist in lowering blood pressure & blood sugar. For ages, lemon has been known
                                    for its medicinal properties, because it helps to strengthen the immune system,
                                    purifies the blood & cleanses the stomach. Lemon is also said, to provide relief in
                                    rheumatism, indigestion, constipation, throat infections, internal bleeding,
                                    respiratory disorders and obesity. It benefits the hair & skin. Lemon is used in the
                                    treatment of kidney stones & lowering blood pressure. It helps to lower body
                                    temperature. Moreover, lemon alkalizes the body & helps in the functioning of the
                                    liver. Green Tea leaves are barely processed. They are not subjected to harsh tea-
                                    treatment methods, which results in a loss of vital nutrients. Green tea is a
                                    powerful antioxidant. It used to control bad cholesterol & treat some minor heart
                                    diseases. Green tea may improve brain functioning, reduce bad breath & may help in
                                    prevention of type 2 diabetes. It also helps to reduce weight by burning fat.
