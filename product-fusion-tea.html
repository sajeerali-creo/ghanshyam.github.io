                                    GINGER LEMON GREEN TEA</h2>
                                <p>Ginger, lemon & green tea is a potent combination, of three beneficial ingredients.
                                    The
                                    flavor is quite complex. It is spicy & sweet. It is a natural energy enhancer.
                                    Let's evaluate the benefits of the three ingredients separately.
                                    Ginger is a common folk remedy, for nausea & an upset stomach. It also aids
                                    digestion &
                                    saliva flow. Ginger may help in painful menstrual peri- ods. Clinical evidence
                                    proves that,
                                    ginger may assist in lowering blood pressure & blood sugar.
                                    For ages, lemon has been known for its medicinal properties, because it helps to
                                    strengthen
                                    the immune system, purifies the blood & cleanses the stomach.
                                    Lemon is also said, to provide relief in rheumatism, indigestion, consti- pation,
                                    throat
                                    infections, internal bleeding, respiratory disorders and obesity. It benefits the
                                    hair &
                                    skin.
                                    Lemon is used in the treatment of kidney stones & lowering blood pres- sure. It
                                    helps to
                                    lower body temperature. Moreover, lemon alkalizes the body & helps in the
                                    functioning of the
                                    liver.
                                    Green Tea leaves are barely processed. They are not subjected to harsh tea-
                                    treatment
                                    methods, which results in a loss of vital nutrients. Green tea is a powerful
                                    antioxidant. It
                                    used to control bad cholesterol & treat some minor heart diseases.
                                    Green tea may improve brain functioning, reduce bad breath & may help in prevention
                                    of type
                                    2 diabetes. It also helps to reduce weight by burning fat.
