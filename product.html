                        <p>There are over 100 species of coffee. But, the two popular ones are Coffea Arabica and Coffea
                            Robusta.
                            Arabica is the most popular kind across the globe and originated in Ethiopia.
                            Coffee beans were brewed for the first time in Arabia. Hence,the name Arabica.
                            Arabia has a sweet flavor, with shades of chocolate, nuts, caramel and fruit. It has more
                            lipids
                            and sugar than Robusta, which enhances it's taste. It is thus more preferred than Robusta.
                            Cold brewing enhances the flavor of Arabica coffee.
                            The beans of Coffea Canephora are called Robusta. This species is found in central and
                            western
                            sub- Sahara Africa. It contains more caf- feine, as compared to Arabica. It is more used in
                            instant coffee and espresso blends of the Italian style.</p>

                        <p>Green coffee beans are raw unroasted coffee beans. The taste of its light green brew is
                            unlike
                            the regular coffee made from roasted beans .It has a milder flavor, with a herbal touch.
                            Though the origins are the same, green coffee has different chemi- cals than roasted coffee.
                            It has high quantities of chlorogenic acids, which are basically health promoting compounds,
                            with powerful antioxidant and anti - inflamma- tory properties. These compounds may lower
                            blood
                            sugar and spikes of insulin. They enhance energy levels and may boost immunity. Green coffee
                            beans can be used for weight management along with a planned diet and exercise plan</p>

                        <h2 class="text-dark mt-4">SOUTH INDIAN FILTER COFFEE POWDER</h2>
                        <p>South Indian filter coffee is made from a blend of roasted and ground Arabica and Robusta
                            beans. These are sourced, from prominent coffee plantations, across the four southern states
                            of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh.
                            Filter Coffee is made by blending boiled and frothed milk with the de- coction. This is
                            obtained, by slow percolation brewing, of finely ground coffee powder, in a filter.
                            The process of roasting coffee beans releases 80% aroma into the powder.
                            Filter coffee has a sweet,delicate and smoother brew. It has less acidic content than
                            espressos.
                            The rich aroma can stimulate the senses and uplift the spirit.</p>

                        <h2 class="text-dark mt-4">COFFEE POWDER WITH CHICKORY</h2>
                        <p>The two popular varieties of coffee, Coffea Arabica and Coffea Ro- busta are blended with
                            chicory to offer a different and refreshing drink.
                            Chicoryor is a herbaceous plant, which is used in salads. It is the roots of the chocory
                            plant that are ground into powder and blended with coffee, to enhance and complement its
                            flavor.
                            Roasted chicory root has an aroma and color similar to coffee. How- ever, it does not have
                            caffeine. It is often used as a caffeine free coffee substitute.
                            Chicory mixed with coffee is popular across the world. Chicory itself is also consumed,
                            because of its sweet caramel flavor and pleasant taste.
                            An ideal blend of chicory and coffee enhances the taste and aroma of coffee, by giving it a
                            slightly nutty and woody flavor.</p>
